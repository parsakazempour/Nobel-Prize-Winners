# Nobel-Prize-Winners

In this project, I used Python for dataset cleaning and preparation, followed by in-depth analysis using Power BI. The project focuses on understanding the gender distribution among Nobel Prize winners and the distribution of prize categories across countries, revealing recognition patterns and trends in diverse fields.
Project Highlights

    **Python Data Cleaning**
    Leveraged Python to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for analysis.

    **Gender Distribution Analysis**
    Explored the gender distribution among Nobel Prize winners to identify patterns and trends in recognition between male and female laureates.

    **Prize Category Distribution by Countries**
    Investigated the distribution of prize categories across different countries, providing insights into the diverse fields of achievement globally.

    **Power BI Visualizations**
    Utilized Power BI to create compelling and interactive visualizations, allowing users to explore the data and findings efficiently.

    **Engaging Dashboards**
    Presented the results through clear and visually engaging dashboards, enabling effective communication of key insights.

**How to Use**

The Python script for data cleaning and preparation can be found in the "Python" folder of this repository. The Power BI file (.pbix) containing the interactive dashboards is available in the "Power BI" folder. Simply download the files to your local environment to replicate the analysis and explore the visualizations.
